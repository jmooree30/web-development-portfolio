              During his internship at CompanyWide, which we happily extended
              from its original duration, he diligently worked on tasks of all
              complexity levels, and was a dedicated team player. He could be
              trusted with all types of work, never failed to live up to the
              challenges we gave him, and listened close for learning from our
              manager of development. I have high hopes for Jacob now that he
              has left CompanyWide to pursue learning React Native full time. I
              highly recommend him for his next position, and hope that he
              continues to fulfil his full potential."
